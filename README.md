# Atlas

A Python-based hardware generator framework targeting firrtl

## FAQ
### Q. Is this Chisel?
A. Essentially yes, but in Python, and slightly different design choices. Also,
all of the Atlas codebase it MIT licensed (I did not look at any of Chisel's 
source code while writing this, only the firrtl spec).
